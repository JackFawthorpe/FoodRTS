The primary advantage of Unreal engine over the other two engines is its graphics capabilities, something that will not be taken advantage of within this project.

Godot was chosen over Unity as the engine is open source, under an MIT licensing. As well as this it has official support for C++, whilst C# and godot script will be explored as options in the development process it does allow to practice C++ skills for other software.
