| AC1   | Given I have food in the factory<br>Then it has a physical representation when being moved by workers                              | `[!!success:Done]`<br>                      |
| AC2   | Given I have food in the factory<br>When I see a physical representation of food<br>Then I know there is a **group** of food there | `[!!success:Done]`<br>                      |
| AC3   | Given food is in the factory<br>And an object is going to interact with it<br>Then it is able to know when it is touching it       | `[!!success:Done]`<br>                      |
| AC4   | Given a worker is holding food<br>When all of the food is put in a container* then the physical representation disappears          | `[!!danger:Coding]`                         |
