| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| AC1   | Given I am a designer in the engine<br>When I want to experiment with new room sizes<br>Then I am able to specify a factory width, length and height in terms of cubes (Godots unit of measurement) | `[!!danger:Coding]` |
| AC2   | Given I am a designer<br>When I have a generic tile for the floor<br>Then I am able to specify the default tile for the factory                                                                     | `[!!danger:Coding]` |
| AC3   | Given I am a designer<br>When I have a generic design for the wall segment (floor to ceiling)<br>Then I am able to specify the default wall texture                                                 | `[!!danger:Coding]` |
| AC4   | Given I am a designer<br>When I select a set of tiles within the factory<br>Then I am able to apply a new texture to just that set of tiles                                                         | `[!!danger:Coding]` |
| AC5   | Given I am a designer<br>When I select a set of wall tiles<br>Then I am able apply a texture to that set of tiles                                                                                   | `[!!danger:Coding]` |
| AC6   | Given I am a designer<br>When I want to create a new factory<br>Then I can import a single scene as a node to set it up and start designing                                                         | `[!!danger:Coding]` |
| AC7   | Given I am a player<br>When I try to move something<br>Then it cannot be moved through floors nor walls                                                                                             | `[!!danger:Coding]` |
| AC8   | Given I am a designer<br>When I want to create non-rectangular rooms<br>Then I can create composite rooms and hide walls                                                                            | `[!!danger:Coding]` |
